At our GitHub project, we take security seriously and strive to maintain
the highest level of security for our users. We encourage all members of our
community to report any security-related bugs they discover to us as soon as
possible. In order to ensure that these reports are handled in a secure and
efficient manner, we have established the following policy:

1. Reporting Security-Related Bugs: If you believe that you have discovered
   a security-related bug in our project, please report it to us immediately
   by sending an email to random.gauss@gmail.com. Please do not open
   a GitHub issue for security-related bugs, as this may put our users at risk.

2. Providing Details: When reporting a security-related bug, please provide
   as much detail as possible, including a detailed description of the issue,
   steps to reproduce the problem, and any relevant code or screenshots.
   This will help us to quickly identify and address the issue.

3. Confidentiality: We take the confidentiality of security-related bug reports
   very seriously. We will keep all information related to the bug confidential
   and will not share it with anyone outside of our team without your
   permission, except as required by law.

4. Resolution: We will work diligently to resolve the issue as quickly as
   possible and will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

5. Public Disclosure: Once the issue has been resolved, we will make a release
   and announce the security fix through our normal communication channels.
   When it makes sense we may also obtain a CVE ID.
